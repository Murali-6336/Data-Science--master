###### Unit 1: Descriptive Statistics, Sprint 1: Dealing With Data

## A First Look at Data
What is this thing called data? Measuring and quantifying reality is a powerful concept, but saying “everything is data!” is perhaps not the most useful way to understand it. Data must be specific and well-defined in order to be comprehensible.

#### Objectives:
* Student should be able to explain what quantifiable data is (and isn't)
* Student should be able to distinguish between common variable types (continuous/discrete, ordinal/categorical)

## Loading data from a variety of sources
Most computational devices generate and process data, but not all data is represented, stored, or transported in the same way. In this module we’ll consider the common ways of actually getting our hands on data, and practice with some real-world examples.

#### Objectives:
* Student should be able to load data from multiple sources into a Python notebook
* Student should be able to clean a dataset using common Python libraries

## Basic Data Visualizations
Once data is loaded, a good first step is to look at it - our software usually gives us summary statistics, but it’s nice to also visualize what is going on.

#### Objectives:
* Student should be able to interpret and select basic plots appropriate for different data types
* Student should be able to create basic plots appropriate for different data types

## Making data-backed assertions
Our goal in presenting data is to use it as evidence in support of appropriate beliefs, statements, or policies. This is a large topic and can employ many advanced techniques - but getting started doesn’t have to be fancy.

#### Objectives:
* Student should be able to infer and support statements based on data
* Student should be able to identify misleading statements not actually backed by the data

# Personal Objectives
* Figure out note-taking
* Flash card storage/creation, create them, study them (something like https://www.flashcardmachine.com/python3.html)
* Continue reading and implementing "Effective Python"
* Prep for and co-deliver talk regarding work on open source project

# Tidbits Learned
* Don't Repeat Yourself vs. Write Everything Twice
* Colaboratory
  * `!` prefix to enter bash shell commands, access underlying file system, e.g. `!unzip file.zip`, `pip install pandas`, `!curl` `!wget`, `!ls`, etc.
  * same as ipython: `?` for docs, `??` for source code, also `help()` as usual
  * GitHub integration is slick, but blending in cloud infrastructure complicates my local file workflow
* [A gallery of interesting Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks) has some dated stuff with inaccessbile datasets
* method vs. property
* recursive solution to
