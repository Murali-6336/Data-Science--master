###### Unit 3: Data Engineering, Sprint 4: Productization and Cloud

Building a real deployed full-stack application, backed by Data Science

My projects from this week:
* [pyflashcards](https://github.com/chrisluedtke/pyflashcards) - a simple way to log and study python tidbits
* [TwitOff](https://github.com/chrisluedtke/TwitOff) - given an arbitrary Tweet-like string, this app identifies which user is most likely to say it
